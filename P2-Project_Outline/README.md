## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will be a job search tracker that will allow job seekers to track their job search journies.

Users will be able to create an account, log in, input relevant information for job postings they're interested, track interviews and where they are in the job search process for each job posting.

I decided to make this project because I heard from other self-taught programmers that they often applied to hundreds of positions, interviewed with a dozen-or-so companies, before they landed their first jobs. With this much work involved in job search, I want a tracking tool, that is more visually pleasing and scalable than my usual Excel spreadsheets, to help me be more effective.

### Features
- User sign-up: users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to create and track the job postings they are interested in
- User login: Users will be able to log in after creating a profile. Authentication will potentially be handled using Spring Security.
- Create, edit and delete job postings: Each user will be able to view and manage his own job postings and job details.
- Create, edit and delete job-related appointments: Each user will be able to manage his job search-related appointments. (E.g. phone and on-site interviews)
- Dashboard: Users will be able view at-a-glance their upcoming asppointments and the job postings they are interested in.
- Search / List job postings: Users will be able to search and/or thier job listings by a variety of pre-defined criteria. (E.g. company name, employment type, location, etc.)
- [II] Admin: An admin with the ability to create, edit and delete users.
